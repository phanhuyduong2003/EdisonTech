# Exercise 02 - Reverse a String

# Task

Pretty simple, write a function called `reverseString` that returns its input, reversed!

## Example

```javascript
reverseString("hello there"); // returns 'ereht olleh'
```

## Hints

Strings in JavaScript cannot be reversed directly so you're going to have to split it into something else first.. do the reversal and then join it back together into a string.
